## Project Description

For my final project, I propose doing a category/cataloging website for comic books and manga. This app would allow users to create a read list or library to hold their own books. Users can then share their read list with other users for recommendations. Or they browse through our list to find new comics or manga to read. The app would function similarly to other social category sites such as Goodreads, Letterboxd, and Anilist. Users can create an account to create their own library and share their reading lists with other users. Users must also sign in to add books to their library or add readlists from other users. On each comic and manga, the user can give a review of their thoughts and a 5-star rating. When completed, this project can serve as a great tool for people finding new comics or manga to read, while keeping track of their read lists.
